PyCMP Installation Guide

1. Set up your favourite web-server with wsgi support(nginx, apache, we used nginx)
2. Set up uwsgi and other packages:
    * uwsgi
    * psycopg2
    * postgresql (9.4)
    * python3 (3.4)
    * libssl-dev
    * scrypt(python module)
3. Set up uwsgi working directory to pycmp folder
4. Configure your PostgreSQL installation and remember your settings
5. Change DB_* fields at the top of db.py file(db module) to your PSQL settings
6. Check, that your pycmp folder must have read AND WRITE access for all subfolders and users!
    Or uwsgi - so our project will not have access to write to my_log.log and read static files.
7. sudo service nginx start
8. sudo service uwsgi start
9. Go to https://localhost/
10. It must work. Or maybe you did sth wrong.
